# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! The goal here is to keep things small, clear, and easy to run locally.

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Make your changes and keep changes small and focused.
4. Run a quick manual test locally (open `index.html` via a PHP server and try the flow).
5. Commit and push your branch, then open a Pull Request.

Guidelines

- Keep the UI accessible and responsive.
- Add comments for non-obvious code and avoid large unrelated changes in a single PR.
- If you add dependencies, include reasoning and keep them minimal.

Reporting issues

Open an issue describing the problem and include steps to reproduce, expected result, and any error messages or logs.

License and CLA
